<H1> Why Primitive Functional interfaces are required. </H1>

In Java, the IntPredicate interface is part of the java.util.function package, and it exists to provide a primitive specialization for the Predicate interface that works specifically with int values. This is part of a broader design pattern in Java aimed at improving performance and reducing memory overhead by avoiding the autoboxing and unboxing of primitive types.

Here are some key reasons why IntPredicate exists:

Performance Optimization:

**_Avoiding Autoboxing:_** Using the generic Predicate<Integer> would require autoboxing of int values to Integer objects, which can introduce performance overhead. IntPredicate works directly with int primitives, eliminating this overhead.
Memory Efficiency: Autoboxing also creates additional objects (instances of Integer), which consume more memory. By working with primitive types directly, IntPredicate reduces memory usage.
Specialized Functional Interfaces:

Java provides specialized functional interfaces for common primitive types (e.g., IntPredicate, LongPredicate, DoublePredicate) to allow developers to write more efficient functional code. This specialization follows a similar pattern for other functional interfaces like IntConsumer, IntSupplier, IntFunction, etc.
Consistency and Clarity:

By having specialized versions of these functional interfaces, the Java API maintains consistency. Developers can clearly see the intended use of these interfaces based on the types they operate on, which enhances code readability and intent.
Using IntPredicate makes the code more expressive and type-safe, as it explicitly indicates that the predicate is meant to operate on int values.

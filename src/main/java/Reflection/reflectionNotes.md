#### Java reflection is a powerful feature that allows you to inspect and modify the structure and behavior of classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime. It provides a way to examine or modify the behavior of applications running in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Here are some key aspects of Java reflection:

- **Inspecting Classes**: You can use reflection to examine the fields, methods, and constructors of a class. This allows you to dynamically discover information about a class's structure.

- **Accessing Fields and Methods**: Reflection enables you to access and modify fields and invoke methods at runtime, even if they are private or inaccessible under normal circumstances.

- **Dynamic Instantiation**: Reflection allows you to dynamically create instances of classes and invoke their constructors.

- **Annotations**: You can use reflection to inspect annotations associated with classes, fields, and methods, enabling you to create more flexible and configurable applications.

- **Performance Considerations**: While powerful, reflection can have performance implications compared to direct method calls or field accesses, as it involves runtime type checking and method lookup.
